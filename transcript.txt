WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.579 --> 00:00:14.398
Um, so the project name is category SIM. So, uh, the objective of this project is basically to recreate the customer quality and, uh, to find out.

2
00:00:14.398 --> 00:00:17.669
The point of the errors in there configuration.

3
00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:22.469
And for achieving that, we need to filter the, uh, particular protocols that.

4
00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:28.440
And, uh, uh, finally, I think so, let us run this script to understand.

5
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.500
So, uh, yeah, ask to quotes for both.

6
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.649
Uh, and if I give unified.

7
00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:46.679
It will ask the engineer to delete whether he wants to further or not. So.

8
00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:52.439
Uh, if the engineer only ones, uh, 6 enabled interfaces, you can also give.

9
00:00:52.439 --> 00:01:04.140
And so, uh, engineer once, uh, interfaces that enabled IV visits and but he doesn't want any interface that he can do this.

10
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.640
And, uh, he can also push take on my attendance on to that. So.

11
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.000
Let me just get the idea here.

12
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.329
Yeah, let me just take this for now.

13
00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.280
At the name and Cisco, uh.

14
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.230
So just take a few moments to speak on.

15
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:43.200
Yeah, so after pushing the con, basically automatically show, uh, give a short and output. So, as you can see the name of this.

16
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.040
Is the same as the name of that so it is being think this might be so.

17
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:59.549
Let me just end this year and a very fluid. So in the filter, then you can see there are only 2 interfaces and both of them have I believe.

18
00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.290
So, this interface also has, I believe, and, uh.

19
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.689
So this is how the filter that works and yeah.

20
00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:13.259
So, let me just do the of this.

21
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:22.740
Now, I'm just putting line of 3131 as you can see, uh.

22
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.120
That is open the documentation here, so.

23
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.960
So, in this documentation, this is 9, 3, 1 and 9 3.

24
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.990
So these are the 2 options that we are using to establish a so.

25
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.250
That is correct.

26
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:54.870
Eva, yeah, so.

27
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.879
As you can see in the output, there are a lot of, uh, results. So.

28
00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.909
Uh, the engineer can also choose to, uh.

29
00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:09.150
See, there is a pretty output, so that, uh, testing, I think will be displayed at 1st and, uh.

30
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.319
The user can expand the interface as the required so.

31
00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.759
Let me just 0.

32
00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:24.060
I say, I say grand and before that, let me just see whether there are any conflicts already here.

33
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.719
Silence.

34
00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.560
Yeah, so now this is not active on this so.

35
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.129
Uh, now, let us just put this.

36
00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:21.720
So, in this page, it will ask for the IP address username and password. So this is this.

37
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.110
Is there an admin.

38
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.860
Password

39
00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:40.855
meanwhile.

40
00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.649
Both.

41
00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:17.428
Now, the so now.

42
00:05:17.428 --> 00:05:20.848
All those fun picks up pushed so.

43
00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:30.689
So, after this, uh, let me just change the address and push it for a 9 of free to ask. So.

44
00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:35.759
Afraid to have 107 so here, uh, we need to change the IP addresses.

45
00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:42.478
So, it's not 02000 and, uh, the IP address would be a 2 1.

46
00:05:42.478 --> 00:05:47.249
And the neighbor, uh, here would be to be.

47
00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.139
So, now that is put it.

48
00:05:54.629 --> 00:06:08.069
So now as you can see, um.

49
00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:15.869
I changed the I paid to do for that 1 and a database has also been pointing. Kenneth has also been implemented. Yeah.

50
00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:19.468
So this is all the conflict.

51
00:06:19.468 --> 00:06:28.288
And, uh, this day, the entire customer quality can be recreated. And, uh, if required necessary interface status can also be made dynamic.

52
00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:32.428
So this is the main purpose of the project.

53
00:06:32.428 --> 00:06:40.379
And as we, uh, acquire VPN, so, uh, it will also puts the PPC ID.

54
00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:44.278
There and, uh, there'll be a proposed theater.

55
00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:54.478
So that can be viewed in the analytics. So I have visited this site once today. So that will also be shown when I'm not operations number of operations.

56
00:06:54.478 --> 00:07:01.528
Everything before, and, uh, I save the conflict will also be visible here. So this is 1 of my conflict.

57
00:07:01.528 --> 00:07:06.988
So, let me just open this. Yeah, so.

58
00:07:08.548 --> 00:07:15.899
So, this can also be viewed for future reference. So this can also be used as some kind of documentation.

59
00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:21.838
And, uh, the same thing can also be used in and that can also be further documents.

60
00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:27.509
So, on the same conflict, uh, it is required to fill out a few, uh.

61
00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:33.509
Keyword, for example, let me just fill out a basic and, uh, let me just, uh.

62
00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:37.798
Yeah.

63
00:07:37.798 --> 00:07:44.668
So, after this, if you only show me 6 enable interfaces, that does not have abbreviate. So.

64
00:07:44.668 --> 00:07:48.629
This interface as enable and.

65
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:51.689
Yeah, so families will also be displayed.

66
00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:56.038
So this is a custom filtering can be done. So.

67
00:07:56.038 --> 00:08:00.959
Caveat can you just said about your, uh, and, uh.

68
00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:10.918
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:08:10.918 --> 00:08:25.738
So this is the also storing the database in normally, we are using Margaret to store the database. So the operations, which we can perform on this is to insert the database and to display the database and to connect the logs.

70
00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:35.668
So haven't shown this, so this is the Ga that we have created. So I have sent it to the 65.

71
00:08:35.668 --> 00:08:39.359
I I require so when I run it.

72
00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.989
Yeah, this is out from the check on so.

73
00:08:45.989 --> 00:08:51.629
Uh, this can be shown in vein.

74
00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:54.899
So, see, if here if if I want to filter.

75
00:08:54.899 --> 00:08:58.558
Some of the configurations and just check them.

76
00:08:59.668 --> 00:09:02.788
So, I selected address from the.

77
00:09:02.788 --> 00:09:08.369
And, uh, in the interface, so now I will save this.

78
00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:23.399
Well.

79
00:10:38.458 --> 00:10:42.208
Uh, can you do it? Uh, I just showed the database how it's done.

80
00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:52.318
Yeah, sure. So, let me.

81
00:10:54.568 --> 00:11:01.019
So, uh, I need to filter.

82
00:11:11.249 --> 00:11:14.489
Yeah, so I'd be yeah.

83
00:11:14.489 --> 00:11:18.389
Got the pretty and select some of the configurations like.

84
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:21.509
Give it a 0 Yeah. Okay.

85
00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:35.219
Okay then save it. Yeah so so now, when we say, which require the restore studio in saved conflicts.

86
00:11:35.219 --> 00:11:38.639
As the file name called.

87
00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:43.019
So this will be stored. Um, so now.

88
00:11:44.219 --> 00:11:47.578
Yeah, now you can see it, right? Yeah.

89
00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:55.708
Yeah, so here in, uh, in the Mongo database, there's donya a collection is, uh.

90
00:11:55.708 --> 00:12:00.089
Made like, see for audits and deal.

91
00:12:00.089 --> 00:12:03.839
Uh, he has anecdotal.

92
00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:11.999
This is the configuration that she wanted to save and this is saved in the molecules, which can be. So there can also be no duplications. Right? So.

93
00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:21.119
No, yeah, duplicates also cannot be created. So whenever you send some configurations, it is 1st check. If the file is already present in it.

94
00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:24.869
It's pressing then it will show you.

95
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:32.999
And store the database, and also the dogs will also be present. And like, how many times have you filtered out? Uh.

96
00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:36.089
And, yeah.

97
00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:39.599
See this 1 yeah.

98
00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:47.129
So, yeah, so it is a completely integrated solution with, uh, properly functioning logs. So, uh.

99
00:12:47.129 --> 00:12:52.528
The further implement that we plan on doing to this is, uh, so once we.

100
00:12:52.528 --> 00:13:04.649
What on the project for that? So that is to use. So, what it does is it automatically figure out the interfaces so instead of us having to manually edit the interfaces.

101
00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:07.979
It'll automatically detect North interface. Are there in our lab.

102
00:13:07.979 --> 00:13:12.269
And actually, I'm automatically map the customer's to accordingly to that.

103
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:18.509
So that is 1 of the improvements and the 2nd implement is all these logs can also be displayed in a graphical format. So that it will be easier to understand.

104
00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:23.969
So these are the, uh, 1 of the few things that we have planned to, uh, for that April on this project. So, yeah.

105
00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:28.019
Uh, it's pretty much what we have done as a part of this project.

106
00:13:31.499 --> 00:13:32.609
Thank you.
